My extensive professional experience, acquired at a young age, has given me a broad spectrum of perspectives. 
This diversity enables me to offer the company innovative and varied ideas. 
I am very passionate about learning coding and solving complex problems. 
Currently I am pursuing turning my theoretical knowledge into practical knowledge and widen my experience to acquire more skills.
